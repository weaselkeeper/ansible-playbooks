ansible-playbooks
=================

Collection of playbooks I find useful



aws-ldap:
	Sets up ldap for aws instances, also adds a supplemental sudoers file.
	Needs an appropriate account on the instance(s) of course.

giftssh:
	Add ssh public key to hosts, a bootstrap issue for poorly configured ansible targets.
